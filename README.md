# SAIRA - Smart AI Recipe Assistant

**SAIRA (Smart AI Recipe Assistant)** is an AI-driven recipe recommendation system designed to provide personalized recipe suggestions based on user preferences. Built entirely with Next.js for both backend and frontend, SAIRA integrates a Python-based recommendation engine through JavaScript using the `child_process` module, enhancing user experience with an interactive and responsive design.

- **Speech Recognition Integration:** Allows voice input for an enhanced user experience.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Frontend & Backend:** Next.js
- **Machine Learning:** TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **APIs:** Hugging Face API for dynamic image generation
- **Script Integration:** Python recommendation script executed through JavaScript using `child_process`

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevSujal/an-intelligent-system-for-receipe-assistance-using-artificial-intelligence.git
   cd an-intelligent-system-for-receipe-assistance-using-artificial-intelligence
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - For the Next.js application:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For the Python environment:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     python -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up API Keys:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Hugging Face API key:
   ```plaintext
   HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   # Start the Next.js server
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run the Python Script:**  
   In a separate terminal, activate your Python virtual environment and start the recommendation script:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source myenv/bin/activate
   python recipe_recommendation.py
   ```

## üí° Usage
1. **Visit the Application:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
2. **Get Recipe Recommendations:** Input your preferences, and SAIRA will suggest recipes tailored to your tastes.
3. **Voice Commands:** Try using voice input for a hands-free experience.
4. **View Recipe Details:** Click on a recommended recipe to see details, including ingredients and steps.

## üåê API Integration
SAIRA uses the Hugging Face API to generate unique images for each recipe dynamically. The Python script leverages the TF-IDF model and cosine similarity for accurate recipe recommendations based on user input.
